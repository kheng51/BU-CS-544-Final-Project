# CS 544 Final Project

This repository contains my final project for CS 544: Foundations of Analytics and Data Visualization.
This course is part of the core curriculum of the MS in Applied Data Analytics Program at Boston University.

## Project Objective:

The data being analyzed originates from the American Communityu Survey 2010-2012 Public Use Microdata Series, introduced to me through the following github repsotiory:
https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/college-majors

The data comprises of a list of college majors with categorical attributes pertaining to the types of people who study each major.

The main object of the project is to use R Studio to apply course concepts such as categorical/numerical variable analysis, bivariate analysis, sampling, and data visualization to identify relationships between variables in this dataset.

## The file contents are as follows:
- CS 544Final_Heng.html: HTML file of report containing code output, visualizations, and analysis.
- CS544Final_Heng.pdf: PDF version of report for easier viewing
- CS544Final_Heng.rmd: R-Markdown File containing raw R code that wrangles data, creates visualizations, and knits report files.
